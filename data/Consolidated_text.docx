--- Sheet: Deal Review Guidance ---
	Items that should be reviewed
	Right resources are tied to the scope (e.g., architect, BA, PM, engineer vs senior engineer)
	Read the SOW and ensure the scope makes sense, what business issues we are trying to solve will be met with the solution
	Review deliverables that are in scope
	Make sure the assumptions, out of scope, in scope look accurate
	Review and adjust project Timeline (not based on resource availability but more in terms of is the timeline accurate to get the work done) - we cannot add more weeks and therefore hours because we don't have the resources, that is a TA problem they will need to solve for otherwise we lose the deal on price.
	Review that the architect and BA are on the project for the correct phases (e.g., if there is a potential ability to reduce roles needed then lets shift the hours - for instance if its an integration project and the SC scoped in BA time for Execute/Deliver/Close, perhaps that can be done by the SA).
	Oversight is accurately accounted for on this scope (look at week by week breakdown, not percentages)
	Try to identify areas to reduce fractionalization (e.g., shifting some engineer hours to architect if it cuts down on timeline).

--- Sheet: Oversight Guidance ---
	The following is guidance for hours for each oversight role based on phases of the engagement (per week).
This covers things like internal and external status calls, testing of code, story refinement throughout delivery, etc. This does not cover the oversight roles doing engineering tasks.

--- Sheet: Assumptions ---
	General Project Assumptions		1.1      Specific Project Use Case Assumptions
	1.      Upon execution of the SOW, NewRocket may require up to 20 business days to identify and schedule resources for this project.   		1.      No mandatory training will be required for this engagement.
	2.      Prior to the start of the project, Nelnet’s functional and technical resources will have completed the appropriate ServiceNow training.  NewRocket is available to recommend the appropriate training.		2.      Nelnet has identified their implementation team and communicated that team to NewRocket.
	3.      At the start of this project, Nelnet will have current and valid licenses to all required third party software applications, necessary or appropriate for the configuration and implementation services contemplated by this SOW, including, but not limited to the ServiceNow software.		3.      Each sprint will have one (1) hour for story grooming and sprint planning and one (1) hour for demonstrations and one (1) hour for questions and answers per sprint
	4.      Nelnet will provide the appropriate functional and technical resource to support NewRocket in the effort outlined in this SOW.		4.      Throughout the solution, OOTB permissions and roles will be used. 
	5.      Nelnet functional and technical management resources are responsible for coordinating and driving the decision-making process within Nelnet’s organization.		5.      For all data loads, NewRocket will provide the templates from ServiceNow and Nelnet will populate it.
	6.      Nelnet’s stakeholders will be available within two (2) business days during this project for meetings to capture requirements, review iterations of the solution during development and return with answers to any questions. Delays greater than two (2) business days may affect the project budget and/or schedule and result in a change request. In the event of delays greater than five (5) business days, NewRocket may reassign project resources to other projects. 		6.      Authoritative Documents and Citations will be used OOTB.
	7.      Workshops and meetings may be performed remotely via online meetings as the project team is geographically diverse. Any onsite services will be subject to expense reimbursement.  		7.      Only meta-data (fields which do not impact workflow, permissions, or calculations) will be updated. 
	8.      All necessary Nelnet functional and technical representatives that fully understand the business processes and requirements will be present during the workshops. Any additional effort required by NewRocket to facilitate the requirement gathering process is not in scope of this SOW.  		8.      OOTB workflow for ALL IRM components will be used and no changes will be made to the workflow or states. 
	9.      No ‘clone-backs’ will be performed between PROD and Non-PROD environments. If ‘clone-backs’ are performed, the project budget and/or schedule may be affected and require a change request to address unanticipated re-work.		9.      Loading of legacy data is out of scope.
	10.   No platform or use case plug-in upgrades will be performed during the project. If any are performed, the project budget and/or schedule may be affected and require a change request to address unanticipated re-work.		10.    Notifications will have no additional recipients or logic.  Changes will be made to wording only.
	11.   Nelnet will provide process diagram(s) so that current processes may be reviewed.		11.   Nelnet has concept of "assessable objects" that can be aligned to ServiceNow function of entities and to which controls can be applied.
	12.   Development of user stories will serve as the primary requirements definition mechanism. Nelnet’s process owners will be responsible for story definition and acceptance criteria with support from NewRocket.		12.   Up to three (3) entity types and profiles will be created"
	13.   NewRocket will use ServiceNow to manage the stories and sprints, which will be hosted in Nelnet’s production environment. 		13.   Control Libraries exist and are in a standardized format to be used within ServiceNow
			14.   Nelnet has documented the relationship between control libraries and asset library already.
	14.   The number of sprints will be based on the workshops and user stories. The number of sprints in this SOW is merely an estimate and is based on a typical deployment of identified ServiceNow modules. Some sprints may proceed in parallel based on use case and resource availability.		Single approval level for Issues will be applied consistently across Issue types.  Automated identifier of an approver will involve no more than one (1) condition.
	15.   Build estimates are based on staying within the OOTB configurations available from ServiceNow. ServiceNow provides a great deal of flexibility within these capabilities. Any requirements that go outside of typical ServiceNow configuration may affect the project schedule and/or budget and result in a change request.  		The Design Approach document in not intended to document OOTB functionality and does not capture technical configuration changes. 
	16.   Any requirements that go outside of typical ServiceNow configuration that could limit upgrades or add administration complexity will be raised for Nelnet’s approval before being implemented.		One attestation template will be generated to apply to controls.
	17.   Build sprint durations assume QA and technical testing activities will be performed as part of each sprint. ServiceNow ATF test cases are out of scope for this project.		Risks will be assessed using a qualitative methodology.  
Risk Assessments will use Standard Risk Assessments within ServiceNow.
	18.   NewRocket will use its own templates for the Design Approach document, SDP and any other documents.		
	19.   NewRocket will follow its own SDLC and the SIM.		
	20.   During testing in UAT, testing will be performed against the in-scope user stories and acceptance criteria. Any assumptions, inferences, or expectations of behavior are considered new requirements.		
	21.   Nelnet will be responsible for writing any necessary test plans or scripts.  		
	22.   NewRocket will provide one (1) configuration change package containing the fixes for any defects identified during UAT.  		
	23.   NewRocket will conduct one (1) knowledge transfer session to Nelnet in preparation for UAT. NewRocket will not be delivering training or developing any training materials as part of this project.  		
	24.   Once the SOW is approved, additions to the number of applications in the solution or the number of participants or stages to the approval workflow will impact the schedule and budget and result in a change request.  		
	25.   NewRocket will provide basic technical knowledge transfer on deployed solutions. Nelnet’s ServiceNow platform team will be responsible for production support of solutions after production release.  Nelnet will be responsible for developing any training materials and for training users.		
	26.   Nelnet will ensure that internal ServiceNow DEV and TEST environments will be in place at the start of the project that will be used for development and test activities with the appropriate ServiceNow modules installed. NewRocket can assist with module setup if necessary.		
	27.   Nelnet will provide NewRocket with access including appropriate rights to Nelnet’s ServiceNow non-PROD environments.		
	28.   NewRocket will perform all development work remotely.  		
	29.   Nelnet will use the following ServiceNow release: San Diego.		
	30.   Nelnet will use the latest versions of ServiceNow solutions (i.e., applications, plugins) available from the ServiceNow store as of the date of the first installation in Nelnet’s DEV environment.  NewRocket will record the versions installed in the DEV environment during the installation process to baseline the versions to be used for the duration of the project.  Any upgrades to newer versions of the applications or plugins during the project will be considered out of scope and subject to a change request.  		
	31.   Nelnet’s PM will be responsible for coordinating all required internal change management processes necessary for migrating solutions to PROD. Nelnet’s ServiceNow platform team will handle required change management processes and migration of update sets to PROD. NewRocket developers will not have administrative access to PROD environment.  		
	32.   All materials will be provided in the English language only.		
	33.   All services under this SOW will be performed during regular business hours from 9 am to 5 pm Eastern Time. If required, NewRocket and Nelnet will mutually agree to work outside of these regular business hours during key project activities.  		
	34.   The project will be delivered by NewRocket in a contiguous fashion. Nelnet and NewRocket are jointly responsible for maintaining this timeframe.  		
	35.   Should any additional services be required or requested beyond those noted to address the scope outline in this SOW, NewRocket will work with Nelnet to mutually agree upon and define such services as part of an additional SOW or change request.

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Boeing is seeking expert consultation and architectural support to facilitate the 
implementation of the ServiceNow Now Assist for ITSM and Digital Product Release (DPR) 
applications.

the DPR application.  
3. PROJ ECT SUMMARY & PURPOSE 
3.1 NOW ASSIST FOR ITSM 
This section of the Statement of Work (SOW) specific to Workstream 1 outlines the scope, 
activities, and deliverables for a Proof of Concept (POC) implementation of ServiceNow's 
Now Assist for ITSM. The primary objective of this POC is to demonstrate the core 
capabilities of Now Assist within a non-production environment, enabling the project 
stakeholders to evaluate its potential value and impact on IT service management 
processes. 
 
This engagement workstream is strictly limited to a POC and will not include deployment to 
a production environment, User Acceptance Testing (UAT), or organizational change 
management. 
3.2 DIGITAL PRODUCT RELEASE (DPR) ADVISORY SERVICES 
This advisory engagement will assess the customer's current use of the legacy ServiceNow 
Release Management 2.0 application. The objectives are to: 
• 
Evaluate the implementation and identify process gaps against best practices. 
• 
Provide an actionable plan to retire the legacy module.

(DPR) solution. 
 
This engagement workstream is purely advisory. All development, configuration, and 
implementation of recommendations will be the responsibility of the customer's internal 
platform team. 
4. TASKS & MILESTONES 
NewRocket’s Implementation Services are specifically designed for organizations 
interested in accelerating process maturity and automating enterprise service delivery by 
leveraging the power of the Enterprise ServiceNow platform. 
NewRocket will lead a series of collaborative workshops with Client key stakeholders to 
assess, guide, and finalize consensus on Client’s requirements. Following the workshops, 
NewRocket will create a set of stories (based on workstream below) and review them with 
Client’s key stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding of the future state ServiceNow 
solution. The stories will then be used as the guidepost with which to deploy the desired 
state within Client’s ServiceNow platform. 
This is a fixed scope, multi-workstream engagement that includes the following 
components (by workstream): 
Workstream 1 (Now Assist for ITSM Proof of Concept) 
- 
Now Assist Use-Case Development Workshops 
- 
Now Assist and NewRocket Agentic AI Product demonstrations 
- 
Proof of Concept Development and Unit Testing (non-production environment) 
- 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Value Realization Dashboard 
 
Workstream 2 (Digital Product Release Advisory Services) 
- 
Workshops to assess current Release Management 2.0 configuration and 
supporting process(es) 
- 
Replacement of the legacy Release Management 2.0 application with DPR product, 
and process gap analysis against industry best-practices 
- 
Formulation of actionable recommendations for functional and technical 
configuration and process changes 
From project initiation to the conclusion of workshops/production support, the holistic 
estimated timeline for this effort is documented in the Timeline section of this statement 
of work based on what is known today. A detailed project plan will be created during the 
Initiate phase and updated after workshops are completed and all in-scope stories are 
documented.

4.3 TIMELINE AND DELIVERABLES 
4.3.1 Document Construction 
All deliverables may go through up to two (2) rounds of review and revision by Boeing. 
Boeing will review the document within five (5) business days and provide consolidated 
feedback and acceptance. Failure to provide a timely review or additional rounds of 
review/remediation may negatively impact the overall project by extending the project 
timeline and scope ultimately resulting in a Change Order. Additionally, NewRocket cannot 
guarantee consistent resource availability in the event the review is extended due to 
Boeing failure. Should Boeing fail to provide acceptance or reason for rejection in writing 
after five (5) business days of review, NewRocket will assume the document is accepted. 
4.3.2 NewRocket Resources 
Project services will be delivered remotely by a global delivery team. Failure of 
Boeing to uphold its obligations to provide timely decisions and direction to 
NewRocket, and/or provide any dependent information as requested by NewRocket 
may negatively impact the overall project by extending the project scope, budget 
and/or timeline and ultimately resulting in a change order.  Client driven changes to 
the timeline set forth in this SOW may incur changes to the budget required to meet 
the scope of this SOW. 
4.3.3 Timeline 
The target timeline to complete the work of each workstream is: 
 
- 
Workstream 1 – Now Assist for ITSM POC – eight (8) weeks 
- 
Workstream 2 – Digital Product Release Advisory Services – six (6) weeks 
Timelines for each workstream assume adherence to understandings laid out in 
this contract.  This timeline is based on effort and duration by Stage in sequential 
order as provided below based on the information available and/or captured in the 
Estimate Effort at time of writing this SOW, but to be confirmed (and perhaps 
modified) during the Plan Stage:

NOTE: The duration estimates are in no way a guarantee of delivery of the 
capabilities reflected in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 but are estimated based upon high 
level scoping and the details provided by Client at the time of this SOW. The 
timeline does not account for other factors such as holidays that go into a project 
schedule. That final schedule will be confirmed at the conclusion of the Plan stage. 
4.3.4 Scheduling Delays 
If Client causes delays or pauses this project for more than 3 consecutive business 
days, NewRocket may re-assign the assigned project team and Client’s project will 
then be rescheduled.  If a project is rescheduled, NewRocket will attempt to assign 
the same resources but does not guarantee the same resources will be assigned.  In 
the event of a Client delay or project pause, Client may choose to ‘hold’ the 
NewRocket team at the contracted day rate of each assigned NewRocket crew 
member, or, in the event of a fixed fee project then at a cost of 100% of the 
prorated daily project fee (i.e./ a $100,000 fixed fee engagement planned to be 
delivered of 75 days = $1,333/day = $1,333/day ‘hold’ fee).  Delays or Pauses shall be 
documented via the Change Order process.

The Way We Work
Stakeholder Roles & Responsibilities
As a key stakeholder your primary role is to act as a point of contact between your user community and the ServiceNow project, helping to ensure your community is represented and consulted throughout the project. The following are the top three items we ask:
Share your business needs and listen to others
Actively participate
Be open and promote change
We need participants to attend meetings, test the tool, evaluate the training material, provide constructive feedback, drive change within the business.
Active participation is far more than providing a list of requirements. 
Communicate effectively to disseminate information to your colleagues.
We need stakeholders to bring a perspective to the table that others might not have and help us ensure that we have not overlooked an important business need.
We also need the participants to understand the business needs of others, helping us to identify common process/tool features that can be leveraged your company.
The adoption of ServiceNow is not about firmly entrenching the way things are currently done within a new tool.
The effort is an opportunity to improve on the way things are currently done; extracting the largest benefit from ServiceNow.
This often means changing the way things are done and that is often more challenging than implementing a tool.

Client Satisfaction Survey Process
The ServiceNow Services Partner Program requires implementation partners to register their services engagement projects. Upon project completion, implementation partners submit Client information which ServiceNow uses to conduct a Client satisfaction (CSAT) survey on behalf of the partner to measure success and gather feedback, which we use to continually improve.
The ratings and feedback we receive is very important to us, as we are dedicated to earning a CSAT of 5 out of 5 (Excellent), as well as identifying areas of improvement based on the feedback we receive.
If there are ever ANY issues during the project that would keep you from scoring our team with a 5 out of 5 (Excellent), please reach out to your project manager or account executive to discuss the issue and we will make it right.

Welcome to NewRocket!
Hi Team TierPoint,
Welcome to NewRocket!
We are delighted you chose NewRocket as your trusted partner! With our deep ServiceNow platform expertise and an agile model that is experience-centric, we can deliver outcomes faster to maximize your investments at scale. Our services and capabilities are aligned to meet your objectives; by designing systems that are easy to use and deliver extraordinary experiences for employees and customers. We look forward to working together on your success. 
In preparation for our collective success, we have prepared a detailed list of some of the pre-requisites we ask our client to begin working on prior to ensure Great Launch readiness.
Project success criteria - Define your KPI’s so that Project success criteria align with your business to ensure that we have specific, measurable outcomes that can act as the ‘north star’ for your implementation.
Publish your KPIs and target outcomes as part of the Project Charter
ServiceNow Training - The core project team and the process / service owners should look to complete at least the on-demand Welcome to ServiceNow - ServiceNow University training while the process / service owners should look to complete training specific to CMDB (Configuration Management Database (CMDB) Fundamentals On Demand - ServiceNow University) , Discovery ( Discovery Fundamentals On Demand - ServiceNow University) and Service Mapping (Service Mapping Fundamentals On Demand - ServiceNow University). 
Customer Success –  ServiceNow Impact  (ServiceNow Impact - Customer Success)  is a customer success product that helps you achieve success your way with value and adoption resources, tailored expertise, health tools, and 24/7 support. While the site requires signing-up for the services, the page for freely available resources is located at (https://www.servicenow.com/resources.html ).
Workshop Preparation – Workshops are vital, they align the technology with the business and output both the requirements and design of the solution. It is important to run internal meetings to prepare for these joint workshops and to ensure the solution is aligned with your processes. Your partnership with NewRocket will help keep you within best practice – for both industry and the platform – do not be surprised to hear a polite ‘no’ and a gentle push towards OOTB (out of the box).
Sales Alignment – At NewRocket we run a formal handover between sales and delivery, this facilitates the correct understanding of expectations. We recommend a similar activity for you so that the project team is aligned with the team responsible for selecting the platform. Additionally, involving your Advisory team from scoping to delivery will aid in these outcomes.
Project Management – Partnership and alignment across the client team, the client Project Manager and the NewRocket Project Manager will set us up for success on scope, timeline, and budget. This includes regular check-ins and co-ordinations with the NewRocket project team.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – UAT for this project is going to consist of evaluating the resulting discovery work that populated CMDB data over the duration of the delivery phase. NewRocket's remit through UAT is one of support, remediation, and enhancement. NewRocket's preferred method is to use the ServiceNow
Agile module in TierPoint’s Production instance to capture stories and track UAT. To support a smooth UAT, having the same resources testing the processes should be the same as the resources defining them in the workshops as the story user acceptance criteria make great test cases.
Know Your Risks – It is important to work with the NewRocket project manager to log initial risks such as: change freezes, other projects, resource alignment, holidays, and timelines that need to be incorporated into the project.
 Communication
Meeting Notes: All workshops will be recorded and accompanied by a list of action items. A best practice recommendation is for all meetings to be scheduled / recorded by a single point of contact (NewRocket or TierPoint)
Executive Summary: Used to run our weekly status calls and summarize the project to key stakeholders. This report will contain information such as: Overall Status, Risks and Issues, Development Overview, Timeline and Budget.
Burn Report: Delivered weekly to show budget usage.
RIDAC Log: Tracking Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions and Change Requests.
Project Plan: To assist with timeline visualization and order of operations, your NewRocket Project Manager will be managing and maintaining a Gantt-style project plan to be reviewed weekly during the status call.
Weekly Status Calls: Weekly call to review the weekly project control documents (project plan, burn report, RIDAC log) with the core TierPoint team.
SCRUM Calls: If needed to aid in both team’s management of open action items, a series of SCRUM calls can be set up for 15 min each to review open action items.
Preparing for Workshops
Right resources:
Decision Maker: Someone to make final decision for TierPoint team.
End User Representation: Assists with continuity between current processes and procedures and future state discussions.
SN Administrator: To better understand how the application will be used by end users and customers.

Client Satisfaction
At NewRocket we measure Client Satisfaction using the following two methods:
Pulse Check Survey Process
At specific checkpoints in the project the NewRocket Project Manager will initiate a Pulse Check Survey to measure client satisfaction. An email is sent with one question and a comments section. Your participation is critical to our success and let’s our crew know what is going well and areas we may need to work on. Proactively addressing issues and open communication will ensure a successful project!
ServiceNow CSAT Survey 
During the delivery phase the Project Manager will review if the project meets the ServiceNow Deployment Registration Requirements. If the project is determined a good fit, a deployment will be created and completed during the delivery phase. A part of the deployment ServiceNow sends out a Client satisfaction (CSAT) survey on behalf of the partner to measure success and gather feedback.
The ratings and feedback received is very important to NewRocket for continuous improvement and being able to pro actively address issues while a project is in flight. Our Project Crew are dedicated to earning a rating of “Excellent” and Client Participation is important.
If there are ever ANY issues during the project that would keep you from rating NewRocket as “Excellent”, please reach out to your project manager or account executive to discuss the issue and we will make it right!

To ensure optimal functionality and value realization from Now Assist Fulfiller skills, several factors across different skills must be 
considered while assessing instances during the pre-implementation phase.
✦
Awareness: Review the readiness assessment tips provided in each of the skill-specific acceleration bundles carefully. They 
provide detailed insights into how best to perform such analysis and how to approach skill-specific scenarios. 
✦
Data Quality: Check for the accuracy and completeness of records in Incidents/Cases/HR cases and Change Requests, 
which directly impact Now-Assist-generated Summaries, Resolution notes, and Knowledge articles
✦
Customizations: If there are customizations to the workflows or processes, tables, or fields, including choice values that are 
being used other than OOB, review them to ensure compatibility with Now Assist Fulfiller capabilities and follow the 
guidance provided in the individual bundles to address them. 
✦
Now Assist Plugin Installation: Always install or upgrade Now Assist skills through the main BU plugins: Now Assist for 
ITSM/CSM/HRSD. Doing so will install or update the dependencies.
✦
Access roles: User roles control access to Now Assist skills. If custom roles are being utilized, consider whether they should 
access the Now Assist skill. Roles can be configured within the Now Assist Admin Console.

Summarization skills can provide a succinct summary of an incident, case, or HR case, enabling an agent to quickly get up to 
speed without reading through all the details within the record. 
✦
Skill Insights
▪
Click the 'Summarize' UI action at the top of the form to generate a summary of the incident or case. 
▪
Now Assist can summarize cases or incidents once they contain at least 50 words within the input fields. 
▪
Starting with Yokohama Patch 3, we can extract and present contextually relevant information from transcribed JPEG 
and PNG attachments within generated incident summaries.
▪
When testing the skill, a record with rich content will provide better insights into the effectiveness of the Summarization 
skills.
✦
Common challenges and solutions
▪
Customizations, such as modifications to the names or labels of the input fields, will result in issues with summarization and 
need to be addressed. Similarly, using custom fields instead of the OOB input fields must also be addressed. The Prompt 
Configuration capability helps with such situations and is detailed within the Summarization Acceleration Bundle.
▪
Incorrect or incomplete summaries: Verify whether relevant fields (e.g., Description, Work Notes) contain meaningful 
data.
▪
When Summaries fail to generate, repairing or updating the Generative AI Controller plugin to the latest version may 
resolve the issue. Refer to KB1700701 for guidance.

Quickly details how the incident or case was resolved by generating a condensed version of the record’s resolution notes 
generated by the record's input fields, such as comments, work notes, and other fields. 
✦
Skill Insights
▪
Resolution note generation is triggered when the agent attempts to resolve the incident or case.
▪
Agents can save time by using the skill instead of manually reviewing the record’s history and drafting resolution content.
✦
Common challenges and solutions
▪
Refer to this community article for detailed guidance on handling additional mandatory fields during resolution so that 
Now Assist Resolution notes are generated seamlessly. 
▪
The Community articles below provide solutions to common customization scenarios:
– ITSM-Handling Resolution customizations 
– CSM-Handling Resolution customizations

KB Generation within the Now Assist Knowledge Management skills allows one to quickly draft knowledge articles based on 
cases, incidents, or work order tasks within the record and from other similar past incidents or cases. This skill reduces agents' time 
commitment to create helpful self-service content to improve deflection rates.
✦
Skill Insights
▪
The 'Create Knowledge' UI action allows agents to generate knowledge articles from resolved or closed incidents/cases.
▪
Now Assist enables article creation from a single or multiple similar incidents/cases to generate more comprehensive 
knowledge articles to be drafted. Agents should review and refine the AI-generated content before publishing. 
✦
Common challenges and solutions
▪
The Now Assist modal pop-up to inform the user that Now Assist has commenced drafting the article occasionally fails to 
appear after clicking 'Create Knowledge' UI Action. Adding the Knowledge Gen AI UI formatters to kb_knowledge 
typically resolves the issue. Refer to KB1710178 for detailed guidance.
▪
Role-based restrictions (added in Now Assist Admin console skill configuration) may not consistently be honored. While 
fixed in XP3, modifying the role-check condition in the 'Create Knowledge' UI action to control button visibility will resolve in 
prior releases. Refer to KB1705341 for detailed guidance.
Knowledge Management Pointers
Note: Reviewing the Knowledge bases to identify optimization opportunities prior to implementing Now Assist KB generation will 
go a long way towards success. Leverage the Knowledge and Search metrics tool to gain such insights. Refer to the Now Assist 
in Knowledge Management acceleration bundle for guidance.

Expedite the Change request process by quickly capturing essential details and generating an associated risk explanation
✦
Skill Insights
▪
Clicking the 'Summarize' UI action on a Change Request (in states other than New or Canceled) generates a concise 
summary from the Short Description, Description, Implementation Plan, Backout Plan, Service Offering, and Justification 
fields.
▪
Clicking the Now Assist sparkle icon next to the Risk field in a Change request displays a Now-Assist-generated risk 
explanation in a window. Note that the Now Assist sparkle icon appears only after the risk is calculated.
▪
The Change Request Risk Explanation skill provides insights based on similar change requests, incidents caused by those 
changes, met risk conditions, and risk assessments.
✦
Common challenges and solutions
▪
If clicking on 'Summarize’ renders the system unresponsive, repairing the Generative AI Controller and UXC Generative AI 
plugins may resolve the issue. Refer to KB1939111 for the details.
▪
Customizations may cause the Change Risk explainer card not to be displayed within the Service Operations 
Workspace(SOW). Upgrading to the latest version of SOW, switching to the out-of-the-box record page, or reviewing the 
customizations and integrating them into a copy of the out-of-the-box record page should resolve the issue.

Summarize chats and provide agents with quick replies based on the context of the conversation with the Chat skills.
✦
Skill Insights
▪
Agents can review key details, reducing the need for the fulfillers to ask, and the requestors to repeat information already 
shared with the Virtual Agent.
▪
Summaries are generated in the following scenarios: 
–
When an agent accepts a live agent request, summarize the Virtual Agent conversation
–
When an agent uses the /summarize quick action within Agent Chat
–
When the conversation or interaction ends, a summary of the entire interaction is generated
▪
Chat Reply Recommendation allows agents to generate quick replies in context by selecting the Now Assist icon in the 
chat message window, saving response time.
✦
Common challenges and solution tips
▪
When Chat skills are activated in multiple BUs, they need to be handled as per KB1956098; otherwise, agents will see an 
error. Assigning specific roles exclusive to each BU tends to help in this scenario. 
▪
If the Now Assist icon is not displayed when Chat reply recommendations(CRR) are activated, refer to KB1974264 to review 
the portal details.

Tip 1: Understand the Requestor Context 
• These serve as the different entry points 
for end-user inquiries, which must be 
analyzed to identify opportunities.
• The requestor-facing applications, focusing on AI 
Search and Virtual Agent, rely on content from 
the Knowledge Base, Service Catalog, and the 
implemented VA Topics (both LLM and NLU-
based).
• An assessment is needed to evaluate the 
maturity of these processes and identify 
potential gaps with the requested use cases.

✦
When addressing a troubleshooting topic, request the relevant knowledge base articles or the specific troubleshooting 
steps to resolve the issue. 
✦
If a record (such as an incident record) needs to be created, ask about any default values for the fields that need to be 
filled in, especially mandatory fields. For instance, ask for the category, sub-category, assignment group, and channel. 
✦
If specific fields are intended to be auto-populated, seek clarification on the logic behind them so that you can add them 
to that within the topic.
✦
Some customers implement assignment rules to auto-populate the assignment group field. Ask for their relevance regarding 
the topic.
✦
Ask If the customer would like to include live agent transfer in the topic and implement it accordingly.
✦
Provide a detailed, thoroughly tested description for each topic to ensure accurate discovery within the Virtual Agent.
✦
Avoid having multiple active topics which are intended to address the same issue.
✦
Review and be aware of known issues and solutions provided in the Requestor-related bundles.
✦
Finally, closely review tips and resources provided in the Now Assist in Virtual Agent Acceleration Bundle at every stage of 
the implementation journey!

Limit Variables: Keep the number of variables 
(including variable sets) minimal.
2.
Disable Conversational Mode: Use the "Make non-
conversational in VA" option for form-based 
requests.
3.
Provide Clear Context: Use distinct names, labels, 
and tooltips to help NowLLM understand item 
context.
4.
Stick to out-of-the-box Variable Types: Use 
standard variable types like Multiple Choice, 
Select Box, and Single Line Text.
5.
Minimize Scripting: Limit client-side scripting and 
use "Validation Regex" for validation.
6.
Avoid Complex Dependencies: Simplify variable 
relationships to ensure a smooth conversation 
flow.
7.
Test & Iterate: Test items in the conversational 
interface and improve based on feedback.

(Note:  Refer to the detailed coverage around Conversational Catalog in the Instance Assessment and Implementation sections)
Use Conversational Catalog Overview 
dashboard to analyze the current Service 
Catalog - not all Catalog Items are good 
candidates for a conversational experience
✓Focus on the top used catalog item
✓Identify the reason for Catalog Items not 
being conversational 
✓Explore suggestions for making items

25
Tip 6: Inspect catalog UI Policies carefully 
✓Avoid Using OnLoad() for UI Policy Changes to 
modify question attributes (e.g., mandatory, visible, 
or read-only).
▪
Solution: Set the attributes directly on the 
questions to ensure efficient and reliable 
behaviour.
✓Avoid OnLoad() Conditions for Uninitialized 
Variables. For example: If a variable doesn’t have 
a default value and a condition tests its value at 
load time, the condition won’t trigger.
▪
Solution: Uncheck the “OnLoad” box for such 
conditions and initialize variables properly 
before checking them.

Improvements are limited by fulfiller UI 
being outdated
•
Data extraction to support 
performance measures are manual and 
are performed using  disparate 
systems. 
•
Boeing supports multi-channel incident 
intake 
•
While the overarching incident process is 
consistent, each support team has the 
bandwidth to personalize procedures
•
MIM is  at a higher maturity
•
Practice is well-deﬁned with three 
change types: Standard (pre-
approved), Normal, and Emergency.

NewRocket -  Boeing POCDemo #2
Friday, 2 January 2026
Today’s Agenda
Skill: Interaction Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis can help you gauge customer emotions, enabling you to provide more empathetic and compassionate customer experiences
Skill = NR Interaction Sentiment Analysis
Key Capabilities enabled for Boeing POC
Use case 
When an agent or requester completes a chat, the overall sentiment is evaluated, and the value Positive/Neutral/Negative is filled in the IMS Sentiment field of the interaction.
The skill looks at the overall tone of the chat and does not necessarily look at the resolution of the interaction. 
Skill: Sentiment Analysis - Positive
Skill: Sentiment Analysis - Neutral
Skill: Sentiment Analysis - Negative
DEMOInteraction Sentiment Analysis(negative with no resolution)
Skill: Incident Description Summary
The skill Incident Description Summary is augmented from the OOTB Incident summary. 
It is designed to trigger on incident creation, when an incident is created through a record producer and summarizes the Description only.
Key Capabilities enabled for Boeing POC
Use case 
When a requester opens an incident through a record producer, currently all the answers get written with no formatting to the output, making it difficult for the agent to read through the actual issue. 
The new incident description summarization skill takes the content of this "jumbled" data and summarizes while keeping the original answers in the description.
Skill: Incident Description Summary
The new skill summarizes the content of the data obtained through the record producer form
The original data are still accessible to the agent
DEMOIncident Description Summarization
Phoebe – Additional features
In this iteration of Phoebe, we have added made it more interactive, adding additional comments for the requester. We have also stopped it from interacting with Event Management incidents
Additional Key Capabilities enabled for Boeing POC
Use case #1 – Self-resolution for In-progress/on-hold Incidents
When a requester enters any of the following statements:
I fixed the issue myself/It's fixed
No longer required/Cancel the incident
Then Phoebe puts a follow-up in additional comments for the requester and resolves the incident
Use case #2 – Incident was resolved but re-opened by requester 
On incident state change from Resolved to In progress, Phoebe will:
Analyze resolution notes, any additional comments added
Engage with the requester, providing further help
If the result of the conversation is deemed to be a new incident, Phoebe leaves the current incident resolved and puts a follow up indicating how to open a new incident
If the result of the conversation is deemed to be the same issue as the current incident, Phoebe re-opens the incident in progress and assigned to its original assignee
Phoebe: Self-resolution (State = In progress or On Hold)
Phoebe: Re-opening -  same issue
Phoebe:Re-opening Different issue
DEMO: Phoebe – Incident Management
Wrap Up

Time from Resolved  In Progress to comment by agent is reduced.
Automation savings  #of Automated closures
4
Manage Request to close ticket from user
Determine Closure reason
Fill in closure notes.
Helpdesk puts incident on hold and people self-resolve but the incident never gets out of hold
Phoebe should scan the on-hold queue for any comment provided by requester and close incidents that have been self-resolved with the appropriate closure reason 
Confirm with incident people, if an email or additional comments is received, does the state move back to in progress

GSEP AI EcoSystem
10/22/2025
Current ServiceNow AI Context
ServiceNow must be able to work in an AI EcoSystem
AI Transactional costs must be considered and optimized
Want to minimize duplication of business process logic outside ServiceNow
Want to minimize duplication or possible violation of access controls
Want to provide parity across user interfaces with respect to what can be done and the responses
Transactions should run as the human user that is evoking the action to ensure native access controls are respected and the necessary audit trail is preserved.

Integration Options to Review
Rest API:
Table API’s – OK for reading data, not good for transactions
SN function specific API – ideal
Boeing custom API – 2nd best choice
Virtual Agent Bot Integration API:
Need more info on when to use
We are looking at this for AskBoeing  Live Agent handoff
Webhooks:
MCP:
MCP Client – this is for consuming AI agents to consume external AI functionality
MCP Server – Would be an alternate way to expose ServcieNow functionality to other tools.

Integration Moveworks and SN VA API
Moveworks Chat Client invokes the ServiceNow Virtual Agent API
Why merely using Moveworks Connectors doesn’t work:
Virtual Agent Bot Interconnect API is asynchronous:
When we send a HTTP POST request, the API responds with the success/failure status. Moveworks Action completes here upon receiving this result.
But the actual VA response is processed later and sent to separate configured outbound REST endpoint.
