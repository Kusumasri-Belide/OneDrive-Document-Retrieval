GSEP AI EcoSystem
10/22/2025
Current ServiceNow AI Context
ServiceNow must be able to work in an AI EcoSystem
AI Transactional costs must be considered and optimized
Want to minimize duplication of business process logic outside ServiceNow
Want to minimize duplication or possible violation of access controls
Want to provide parity across user interfaces with respect to what can be done and the responses
Transactions should run as the human user that is evoking the action to ensure native access controls are respected and the necessary audit trail is preserved.

Integration Options to Review
Rest API:
Table API’s – OK for reading data, not good for transactions
SN function specific API – ideal
Boeing custom API – 2nd best choice
Virtual Agent Bot Integration API:
Need more info on when to use
We are looking at this for AskBoeing  Live Agent handoff
Webhooks:
MCP:
MCP Client – this is for consuming AI agents to consume external AI functionality
MCP Server – Would be an alternate way to expose ServcieNow functionality to other tools.
