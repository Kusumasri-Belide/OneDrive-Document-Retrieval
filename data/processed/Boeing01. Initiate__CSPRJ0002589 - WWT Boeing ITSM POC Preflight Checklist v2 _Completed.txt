This document provides a checklist and questions for Boeing to complete prior to the workshops. The completion of this document will enable our teams to prepare for the workshops and make the most effective use of our time together.

These questions will all be addressed during the workshops, but the more information available prior to the workshops, the more efficient and focused the workshop sessions will be.
