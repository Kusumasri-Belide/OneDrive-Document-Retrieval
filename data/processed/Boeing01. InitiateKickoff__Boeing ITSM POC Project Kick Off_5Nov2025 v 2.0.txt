The Way We Work
Stakeholder Roles & Responsibilities
As a key stakeholder your primary role is to act as a point of contact between your user community and the ServiceNow project, helping to ensure your community is represented and consulted throughout the project. The following are the top three items we ask:
Share your business needs and listen to others
Actively participate
Be open and promote change
We need participants to attend meetings, test the tool, evaluate the training material, provide constructive feedback, drive change within the business.
Active participation is far more than providing a list of requirements. 
Communicate effectively to disseminate information to your colleagues.
We need stakeholders to bring a perspective to the table that others might not have and help us ensure that we have not overlooked an important business need.
We also need the participants to understand the business needs of others, helping us to identify common process/tool features that can be leveraged your company.
The adoption of ServiceNow is not about firmly entrenching the way things are currently done within a new tool.
The effort is an opportunity to improve on the way things are currently done; extracting the largest benefit from ServiceNow.
This often means changing the way things are done and that is often more challenging than implementing a tool.

Outcomes & Success Criteria
Client Satisfaction Survey Process
The ServiceNow Services Partner Program requires implementation partners to register their services engagement projects. Upon project completion, implementation partners submit Client information which ServiceNow uses to conduct a Client satisfaction (CSAT) survey on behalf of the partner to measure success and gather feedback, which we use to continually improve.
The ratings and feedback we receive is very important to us, as we are dedicated to earning a CSAT of 5 out of 5 (Excellent), as well as identifying areas of improvement based on the feedback we receive.
If there are ever ANY issues during the project that would keep you from scoring our team with a 5 out of 5 (Excellent), please reach out to your project manager or account executive to discuss the issue and we will make it right.
