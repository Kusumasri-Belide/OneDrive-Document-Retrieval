Integration Moveworks and SN VA API
Moveworks Chat Client invokes the ServiceNow Virtual Agent API
Why merely using Moveworks Connectors doesn’t work:
Virtual Agent Bot Interconnect API is asynchronous:
When we send a HTTP POST request, the API responds with the success/failure status. Moveworks Action completes here upon receiving this result.
But the actual VA response is processed later and sent to separate configured outbound REST endpoint.
