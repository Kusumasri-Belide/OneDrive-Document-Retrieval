To ensure optimal functionality and value realization from Now Assist Fulfiller skills, several factors across different skills must be 
considered while assessing instances during the pre-implementation phase.
✦
Awareness: Review the readiness assessment tips provided in each of the skill-specific acceleration bundles carefully. They 
provide detailed insights into how best to perform such analysis and how to approach skill-specific scenarios. 
✦
Data Quality: Check for the accuracy and completeness of records in Incidents/Cases/HR cases and Change Requests, 
which directly impact Now-Assist-generated Summaries, Resolution notes, and Knowledge articles
✦
Customizations: If there are customizations to the workflows or processes, tables, or fields, including choice values that are 
being used other than OOB, review them to ensure compatibility with Now Assist Fulfiller capabilities and follow the 
guidance provided in the individual bundles to address them. 
✦
Now Assist Plugin Installation: Always install or upgrade Now Assist skills through the main BU plugins: Now Assist for 
ITSM/CSM/HRSD. Doing so will install or update the dependencies.
✦
Access roles: User roles control access to Now Assist skills. If custom roles are being utilized, consider whether they should 
access the Now Assist skill. Roles can be configured within the Now Assist Admin Console.

Skill-specific Pointers for Fulfiller Persona
Acceleration Bundle Overview
This section provides some key pointers around each of the individual fulfiller skills that can help 
during the implementation journey

Summarization skills can provide a succinct summary of an incident, case, or HR case, enabling an agent to quickly get up to 
speed without reading through all the details within the record. 
✦
Skill Insights
▪
Click the 'Summarize' UI action at the top of the form to generate a summary of the incident or case. 
▪
Now Assist can summarize cases or incidents once they contain at least 50 words within the input fields. 
▪
Starting with Yokohama Patch 3, we can extract and present contextually relevant information from transcribed JPEG 
and PNG attachments within generated incident summaries.
▪
When testing the skill, a record with rich content will provide better insights into the effectiveness of the Summarization 
skills.
✦
Common challenges and solutions
▪
Customizations, such as modifications to the names or labels of the input fields, will result in issues with summarization and 
need to be addressed. Similarly, using custom fields instead of the OOB input fields must also be addressed. The Prompt 
Configuration capability helps with such situations and is detailed within the Summarization Acceleration Bundle.
▪
Incorrect or incomplete summaries: Verify whether relevant fields (e.g., Description, Work Notes) contain meaningful 
data.
▪
When Summaries fail to generate, repairing or updating the Generative AI Controller plugin to the latest version may 
resolve the issue. Refer to KB1700701 for guidance.

Quickly details how the incident or case was resolved by generating a condensed version of the record’s resolution notes 
generated by the record's input fields, such as comments, work notes, and other fields. 
✦
Skill Insights
▪
Resolution note generation is triggered when the agent attempts to resolve the incident or case.
▪
Agents can save time by using the skill instead of manually reviewing the record’s history and drafting resolution content.
✦
Common challenges and solutions
▪
Refer to this community article for detailed guidance on handling additional mandatory fields during resolution so that 
Now Assist Resolution notes are generated seamlessly. 
▪
The Community articles below provide solutions to common customization scenarios:
– ITSM-Handling Resolution customizations 
– CSM-Handling Resolution customizations

KB Generation within the Now Assist Knowledge Management skills allows one to quickly draft knowledge articles based on 
cases, incidents, or work order tasks within the record and from other similar past incidents or cases. This skill reduces agents' time 
commitment to create helpful self-service content to improve deflection rates.
✦
Skill Insights
▪
The 'Create Knowledge' UI action allows agents to generate knowledge articles from resolved or closed incidents/cases.
▪
Now Assist enables article creation from a single or multiple similar incidents/cases to generate more comprehensive 
knowledge articles to be drafted. Agents should review and refine the AI-generated content before publishing. 
✦
Common challenges and solutions
▪
The Now Assist modal pop-up to inform the user that Now Assist has commenced drafting the article occasionally fails to 
appear after clicking 'Create Knowledge' UI Action. Adding the Knowledge Gen AI UI formatters to kb_knowledge 
typically resolves the issue. Refer to KB1710178 for detailed guidance.
▪
Role-based restrictions (added in Now Assist Admin console skill configuration) may not consistently be honored. While 
fixed in XP3, modifying the role-check condition in the 'Create Knowledge' UI action to control button visibility will resolve in 
prior releases. Refer to KB1705341 for detailed guidance.
Knowledge Management Pointers
Note: Reviewing the Knowledge bases to identify optimization opportunities prior to implementing Now Assist KB generation will 
go a long way towards success. Leverage the Knowledge and Search metrics tool to gain such insights. Refer to the Now Assist 
in Knowledge Management acceleration bundle for guidance.

Expedite the Change request process by quickly capturing essential details and generating an associated risk explanation
✦
Skill Insights
▪
Clicking the 'Summarize' UI action on a Change Request (in states other than New or Canceled) generates a concise 
summary from the Short Description, Description, Implementation Plan, Backout Plan, Service Offering, and Justification 
fields.
▪
Clicking the Now Assist sparkle icon next to the Risk field in a Change request displays a Now-Assist-generated risk 
explanation in a window. Note that the Now Assist sparkle icon appears only after the risk is calculated.
▪
The Change Request Risk Explanation skill provides insights based on similar change requests, incidents caused by those 
changes, met risk conditions, and risk assessments.
✦
Common challenges and solutions
▪
If clicking on 'Summarize’ renders the system unresponsive, repairing the Generative AI Controller and UXC Generative AI 
plugins may resolve the issue. Refer to KB1939111 for the details.
▪
Customizations may cause the Change Risk explainer card not to be displayed within the Service Operations 
Workspace(SOW). Upgrading to the latest version of SOW, switching to the out-of-the-box record page, or reviewing the 
customizations and integrating them into a copy of the out-of-the-box record page should resolve the issue.

Summarize chats and provide agents with quick replies based on the context of the conversation with the Chat skills.
✦
Skill Insights
▪
Agents can review key details, reducing the need for the fulfillers to ask, and the requestors to repeat information already 
shared with the Virtual Agent.
▪
Summaries are generated in the following scenarios: 
–
When an agent accepts a live agent request, summarize the Virtual Agent conversation
–
When an agent uses the /summarize quick action within Agent Chat
–
When the conversation or interaction ends, a summary of the entire interaction is generated
▪
Chat Reply Recommendation allows agents to generate quick replies in context by selecting the Now Assist icon in the 
chat message window, saving response time.
✦
Common challenges and solution tips
▪
When Chat skills are activated in multiple BUs, they need to be handled as per KB1956098; otherwise, agents will see an 
error. Assigning specific roles exclusive to each BU tends to help in this scenario. 
▪
If the Now Assist icon is not displayed when Chat reply recommendations(CRR) are activated, refer to KB1974264 to review 
the portal details.
