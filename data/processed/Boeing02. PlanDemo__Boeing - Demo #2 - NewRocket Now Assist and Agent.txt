Sentiment Analysis can help you gauge customer emotions, enabling you to provide more empathetic and compassionate customer experiences

Use case 
When an agent or requester completes a chat, the overall sentiment is evaluated, and the value Positive/Neutral/Negative is filled in the IMS Sentiment field of the interaction.
The skill looks at the overall tone of the chat and does not necessarily look at the resolution of the interaction.

Skill: Incident Description Summary
The skill Incident Description Summary is augmented from the OOTB Incident summary. 
It is designed to trigger on incident creation, when an incident is created through a record producer and summarizes the Description only.
Key Capabilities enabled for Boeing POC
Use case 
When a requester opens an incident through a record producer, currently all the answers get written with no formatting to the output, making it difficult for the agent to read through the actual issue. 
The new incident description summarization skill takes the content of this "jumbled" data and summarizes while keeping the original answers in the description.
Skill: Incident Description Summary
The new skill summarizes the content of the data obtained through the record producer form
The original data are still accessible to the agent

Phoebe – Additional features
In this iteration of Phoebe, we have added made it more interactive, adding additional comments for the requester. We have also stopped it from interacting with Event Management incidents
Additional Key Capabilities enabled for Boeing POC
Use case #1 – Self-resolution for In-progress/on-hold Incidents
When a requester enters any of the following statements:
I fixed the issue myself/It's fixed
No longer required/Cancel the incident
Then Phoebe puts a follow-up in additional comments for the requester and resolves the incident
Use case #2 – Incident was resolved but re-opened by requester 
On incident state change from Resolved to In progress, Phoebe will:
Analyze resolution notes, any additional comments added
Engage with the requester, providing further help
If the result of the conversation is deemed to be a new incident, Phoebe leaves the current incident resolved and puts a follow up indicating how to open a new incident
If the result of the conversation is deemed to be the same issue as the current incident, Phoebe re-opens the incident in progress and assigned to its original assignee
Phoebe: Self-resolution (State = In progress or On Hold)
