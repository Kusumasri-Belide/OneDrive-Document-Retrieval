Tip 1: Understand the Requestor Context 
• These serve as the different entry points 
for end-user inquiries, which must be 
analyzed to identify opportunities.
• The requestor-facing applications, focusing on AI 
Search and Virtual Agent, rely on content from 
the Knowledge Base, Service Catalog, and the 
implemented VA Topics (both LLM and NLU-
based).
• An assessment is needed to evaluate the 
maturity of these processes and identify 
potential gaps with the requested use cases.

Tip 2: Understand the Requestor Assessment process
✦
The Now Assist Requestor persona's assessment process involves:
•
Leveraging what is already available in the platform prior to beginning the implementation journey:
▪
Understanding the current state of the Knowledge base to identify opportunities for improvement that enhance the 
search experience, referring to the relevant sections within the Now Assist - Data Readiness Checklist.
▪
Understanding the current state of the Service Catalog is key to understanding conversational improvement 
opportunities. Refer to the relevant sections within the Now Assist - Data Readiness Checklist.
▪
Assessing the most requested intents based on historical data using tools like Automation Discovery
▪
Automate tasks by enabling AI Agents in Now Assist Virtual Agent to increase the productivity of live agents
▪
Assessing the current state of self-service, particularly when VA is live, to identify VA topics to be migrated to Now Assist 
to benefit from LLM-powered capabilities
•
Review Now Assist Requestor Discovery & Analysis for insights, tips, and tools to support the assessment!

✦
When addressing a troubleshooting topic, request the relevant knowledge base articles or the specific troubleshooting 
steps to resolve the issue. 
✦
If a record (such as an incident record) needs to be created, ask about any default values for the fields that need to be 
filled in, especially mandatory fields. For instance, ask for the category, sub-category, assignment group, and channel. 
✦
If specific fields are intended to be auto-populated, seek clarification on the logic behind them so that you can add them 
to that within the topic.
✦
Some customers implement assignment rules to auto-populate the assignment group field. Ask for their relevance regarding 
the topic.
✦
Ask If the customer would like to include live agent transfer in the topic and implement it accordingly.
✦
Provide a detailed, thoroughly tested description for each topic to ensure accurate discovery within the Virtual Agent.
✦
Avoid having multiple active topics which are intended to address the same issue.
✦
Review and be aware of known issues and solutions provided in the Requestor-related bundles.
✦
Finally, closely review tips and resources provided in the Now Assist in Virtual Agent Acceleration Bundle at every stage of 
the implementation journey!
Tip 5: Follow VA Topic Development best practices

process, including topic discovery.
✦
Customer-specific technical requirements
Make note of any customer-specific technical requirements 
needed so that customer tech leads can confirm.
✦
Step-by-step instructions
Customers prefer short, concise instructions to be given to 
users within topic. Linking to KB articles should be 
secondary.

Tip 6: Follow Now Assist Search best practices 
✦
Help the customer understand the technology (detailed on the next slide)
✦
AI Search is only as effective as the quality of the underlying information (Knowledge Base, Catalog). Ensure content is 
consistently updated and accurate. 
✦
Leverage the Knowledge & Search Metrics tool and OOTB AI Search & Knowledge dashboards to gain readiness insights
✦
Use clear titles, concise summaries, and relevant keywords in the KB articles and catalog items. Organize information in a 
logical format to make it easier for AI Search to deliver accurate results.
✦
Review and be aware of known issues and solutions provided in the Requestor-related bundles.
✦
Finally, closely review the tips and resources provided in the Now Assist in AI Search Acceleration Bundle at every stage of 
implementation journey!

Tip 2b: Use the Refine Content skill in Catalog Builder for a 
better conversational experience 
•
The Refine feature in Catalog Builder,  
available for fields like Short Description and 
Description, helps improve the conversational 
experience by making the item more 
discoverable
Note: The Refine Content skill available for Now Assist 
for Creator must be enabled to be used within the

Tip 2c: Use the Refine Content skill in Catalog Builder for 
Questions and Labels
•
The Refine Content skill in Now Assist for 
Creator can be used within Catalog Builder 
for Questions and Labels to improve the 
values of these variables, which will improve 
the item's understandability when 
requested conversationally in Virtual Agent. 
Note: The Refine Content skill available for Now 
Assist for Creator must be enabled to be used 
within the Catalog Builder.

capabilities to provide a human-
like and efficient catalog request 
experience over a conversational 
interface like ServiceNow Virtual 
Agent web experience, Microsoft

23
Tip 4: Follow the Catalog Item best practices
1.
Limit Variables: Keep the number of variables 
(including variable sets) minimal.
2.
Disable Conversational Mode: Use the "Make non-
conversational in VA" option for form-based 
requests.
3.
Provide Clear Context: Use distinct names, labels, 
and tooltips to help NowLLM understand item 
context.
4.
Stick to out-of-the-box Variable Types: Use 
standard variable types like Multiple Choice, 
Select Box, and Single Line Text.
5.
Minimize Scripting: Limit client-side scripting and 
use "Validation Regex" for validation.
6.
Avoid Complex Dependencies: Simplify variable 
relationships to ensure a smooth conversation 
flow.
7.
Test & Iterate: Test items in the conversational 
interface and improve based on feedback.
•
Below are some pointers to keep in mind when creating a catalog item to have the catalog as conversational. Refer to 
this Community link which provides guidance around converting Catalog Items to Conversational.

(Note:  Refer to the detailed coverage around Conversational Catalog in the Instance Assessment and Implementation sections)
Use Conversational Catalog Overview

Catalog - not all Catalog Items are good 
candidates for a conversational experience
✓Focus on the top used catalog item
✓Identify the reason for Catalog Items not 
being conversational 
✓Explore suggestions for making items 
conversational

25
Tip 6: Inspect catalog UI Policies carefully 
✓Avoid Using OnLoad() for UI Policy Changes to 
modify question attributes (e.g., mandatory, visible, 
or read-only).
▪
Solution: Set the attributes directly on the 
questions to ensure efficient and reliable 
behaviour.
✓Avoid OnLoad() Conditions for Uninitialized 
Variables. For example: If a variable doesn’t have 
a default value and a condition tests its value at 
load time, the condition won’t trigger.
▪
Solution: Uncheck the “OnLoad” box for such 
conditions and initialize variables properly 
before checking them.
