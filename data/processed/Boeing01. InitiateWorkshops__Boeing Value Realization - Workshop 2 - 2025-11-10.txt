Disparate portals exist, leading to fragmented user experience and disconnected fulfillment.  
Built on Service Portal, not yet on Employee Center. 
End user experience is very fragmented, static and not cohesive. 
Service Catalog Management process oversight is mature. 
User experience and consumption of the catalog items for self-service/ support requests can be matured. 
 Boeing’s Knowledge Management is highly mature and formalized
There are around 11,000 IT knowledge articles in the system, indicating a vast repository that covers a wide array of topics – a strength for self-service and support
EHD supports multiple channels
Improvements are limited by fulfiller UI being outdated
Data extraction to support performance measures are manual and are performed using  disparate systems.

Boeing supports multi-channel incident intake 
While the overarching incident process is consistent, each support team has the bandwidth to personalize procedures
MIM is  at a higher maturity
Practice is well-defined with three change types: Standard (pre-approved), Normal, and Emergency.
Changes are perceived to be the major cause of incidents
Module is significantly customized to support process
Major problem management is mature, featuring structured workflows, evidence-based RCA, and clear accountability
The enterprise problem management process is inconsistent and team-driven, with low overall adoption of the problem module
Boeing’s release management is thorough.
Release deployments are managed as formal events, often done after-hours or in maintenance windows.
The team is actively working on DPR, to enhance integration with ADO
