--- Sheet: Deal Review Guidance ---
	Items that should be reviewed
	Right resources are tied to the scope (e.g., architect, BA, PM, engineer vs senior engineer)
	Read the SOW and ensure the scope makes sense, what business issues we are trying to solve will be met with the solution
	Review deliverables that are in scope
	Make sure the assumptions, out of scope, in scope look accurate
	Review and adjust project Timeline (not based on resource availability but more in terms of is the timeline accurate to get the work done) - we cannot add more weeks and therefore hours because we don't have the resources, that is a TA problem they will need to solve for otherwise we lose the deal on price.
	Review that the architect and BA are on the project for the correct phases (e.g., if there is a potential ability to reduce roles needed then lets shift the hours - for instance if its an integration project and the SC scoped in BA time for Execute/Deliver/Close, perhaps that can be done by the SA).
	Oversight is accurately accounted for on this scope (look at week by week breakdown, not percentages)
	Try to identify areas to reduce fractionalization (e.g., shifting some engineer hours to architect if it cuts down on timeline).

--- Sheet: Oversight Guidance ---
	The following is guidance for hours for each oversight role based on phases of the engagement (per week).
This covers things like internal and external status calls, testing of code, story refinement throughout delivery, etc. This does not cover the oversight roles doing engineering tasks.

--- Sheet: Assumptions ---
	General Project Assumptions		1.1      Specific Project Use Case Assumptions
	1.      Upon execution of the SOW, NewRocket may require up to 20 business days to identify and schedule resources for this project.   		1.      No mandatory training will be required for this engagement.
	2.      Prior to the start of the project, Nelnet’s functional and technical resources will have completed the appropriate ServiceNow training.  NewRocket is available to recommend the appropriate training.		2.      Nelnet has identified their implementation team and communicated that team to NewRocket.
	3.      At the start of this project, Nelnet will have current and valid licenses to all required third party software applications, necessary or appropriate for the configuration and implementation services contemplated by this SOW, including, but not limited to the ServiceNow software.		3.      Each sprint will have one (1) hour for story grooming and sprint planning and one (1) hour for demonstrations and one (1) hour for questions and answers per sprint
	4.      Nelnet will provide the appropriate functional and technical resource to support NewRocket in the effort outlined in this SOW.		4.      Throughout the solution, OOTB permissions and roles will be used. 
	5.      Nelnet functional and technical management resources are responsible for coordinating and driving the decision-making process within Nelnet’s organization.		5.      For all data loads, NewRocket will provide the templates from ServiceNow and Nelnet will populate it.
	6.      Nelnet’s stakeholders will be available within two (2) business days during this project for meetings to capture requirements, review iterations of the solution during development and return with answers to any questions. Delays greater than two (2) business days may affect the project budget and/or schedule and result in a change request. In the event of delays greater than five (5) business days, NewRocket may reassign project resources to other projects. 		6.      Authoritative Documents and Citations will be used OOTB.
	7.      Workshops and meetings may be performed remotely via online meetings as the project team is geographically diverse. Any onsite services will be subject to expense reimbursement.  		7.      Only meta-data (fields which do not impact workflow, permissions, or calculations) will be updated. 
	8.      All necessary Nelnet functional and technical representatives that fully understand the business processes and requirements will be present during the workshops. Any additional effort required by NewRocket to facilitate the requirement gathering process is not in scope of this SOW.  		8.      OOTB workflow for ALL IRM components will be used and no changes will be made to the workflow or states. 
	9.      No ‘clone-backs’ will be performed between PROD and Non-PROD environments. If ‘clone-backs’ are performed, the project budget and/or schedule may be affected and require a change request to address unanticipated re-work.		9.      Loading of legacy data is out of scope.
	10.   No platform or use case plug-in upgrades will be performed during the project. If any are performed, the project budget and/or schedule may be affected and require a change request to address unanticipated re-work.		10.    Notifications will have no additional recipients or logic.  Changes will be made to wording only.
	11.   Nelnet will provide process diagram(s) so that current processes may be reviewed.		11.   Nelnet has concept of "assessable objects" that can be aligned to ServiceNow function of entities and to which controls can be applied.
	12.   Development of user stories will serve as the primary requirements definition mechanism. Nelnet’s process owners will be responsible for story definition and acceptance criteria with support from NewRocket.		12.   Up to three (3) entity types and profiles will be created"
	13.   NewRocket will use ServiceNow to manage the stories and sprints, which will be hosted in Nelnet’s production environment. 		13.   Control Libraries exist and are in a standardized format to be used within ServiceNow
			14.   Nelnet has documented the relationship between control libraries and asset library already.
	14.   The number of sprints will be based on the workshops and user stories. The number of sprints in this SOW is merely an estimate and is based on a typical deployment of identified ServiceNow modules. Some sprints may proceed in parallel based on use case and resource availability.		Single approval level for Issues will be applied consistently across Issue types.  Automated identifier of an approver will involve no more than one (1) condition.
	15.   Build estimates are based on staying within the OOTB configurations available from ServiceNow. ServiceNow provides a great deal of flexibility within these capabilities. Any requirements that go outside of typical ServiceNow configuration may affect the project schedule and/or budget and result in a change request.  		The Design Approach document in not intended to document OOTB functionality and does not capture technical configuration changes. 
	16.   Any requirements that go outside of typical ServiceNow configuration that could limit upgrades or add administration complexity will be raised for Nelnet’s approval before being implemented.		One attestation template will be generated to apply to controls.
	17.   Build sprint durations assume QA and technical testing activities will be performed as part of each sprint. ServiceNow ATF test cases are out of scope for this project.		Risks will be assessed using a qualitative methodology.  
Risk Assessments will use Standard Risk Assessments within ServiceNow.
	18.   NewRocket will use its own templates for the Design Approach document, SDP and any other documents.		
	19.   NewRocket will follow its own SDLC and the SIM.		
	20.   During testing in UAT, testing will be performed against the in-scope user stories and acceptance criteria. Any assumptions, inferences, or expectations of behavior are considered new requirements.		
	21.   Nelnet will be responsible for writing any necessary test plans or scripts.  		
	22.   NewRocket will provide one (1) configuration change package containing the fixes for any defects identified during UAT.  		
	23.   NewRocket will conduct one (1) knowledge transfer session to Nelnet in preparation for UAT. NewRocket will not be delivering training or developing any training materials as part of this project.  		
	24.   Once the SOW is approved, additions to the number of applications in the solution or the number of participants or stages to the approval workflow will impact the schedule and budget and result in a change request.  		
	25.   NewRocket will provide basic technical knowledge transfer on deployed solutions. Nelnet’s ServiceNow platform team will be responsible for production support of solutions after production release.  Nelnet will be responsible for developing any training materials and for training users.		
	26.   Nelnet will ensure that internal ServiceNow DEV and TEST environments will be in place at the start of the project that will be used for development and test activities with the appropriate ServiceNow modules installed. NewRocket can assist with module setup if necessary.		
	27.   Nelnet will provide NewRocket with access including appropriate rights to Nelnet’s ServiceNow non-PROD environments.		
	28.   NewRocket will perform all development work remotely.  		
	29.   Nelnet will use the following ServiceNow release: San Diego.		
	30.   Nelnet will use the latest versions of ServiceNow solutions (i.e., applications, plugins) available from the ServiceNow store as of the date of the first installation in Nelnet’s DEV environment.  NewRocket will record the versions installed in the DEV environment during the installation process to baseline the versions to be used for the duration of the project.  Any upgrades to newer versions of the applications or plugins during the project will be considered out of scope and subject to a change request.  		
	31.   Nelnet’s PM will be responsible for coordinating all required internal change management processes necessary for migrating solutions to PROD. Nelnet’s ServiceNow platform team will handle required change management processes and migration of update sets to PROD. NewRocket developers will not have administrative access to PROD environment.  		
	32.   All materials will be provided in the English language only.		
	33.   All services under this SOW will be performed during regular business hours from 9 am to 5 pm Eastern Time. If required, NewRocket and Nelnet will mutually agree to work outside of these regular business hours during key project activities.  		
	34.   The project will be delivered by NewRocket in a contiguous fashion. Nelnet and NewRocket are jointly responsible for maintaining this timeframe.  		
	35.   Should any additional services be required or requested beyond those noted to address the scope outline in this SOW, NewRocket will work with Nelnet to mutually agree upon and define such services as part of an additional SOW or change request.
