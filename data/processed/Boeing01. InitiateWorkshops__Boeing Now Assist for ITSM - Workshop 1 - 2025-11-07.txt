Current State Assessment
End User Experience 
(Portal/ Self Service)
•
Disparate portals exist, leading to 
fragmented user experience and 
disconnected fulfillment.  
•
Built on Service Portal, not yet on Employee 
Center. 
•
End user experience is very fragmented, 
static and not cohesive.

•
Service Catalog Management 
process oversight is mature. 
•
User experience and consumption 
of the catalog items for self-
service/ support requests can be 
matured. 
•
 Boeing’s Knowledge Management is 
highly mature and formalized
•
There are around 11,000 IT knowledge 
articles in the system, indicating a vast 
repository that covers a wide array of 
topics – a strength for self-service and 
support
•
EHD supports multiple channels
•
Improvements are limited by fulfiller UI 
being outdated
•
Data extraction to support 
performance measures are manual and 
are performed using  disparate 
systems. 
•
Boeing supports multi-channel incident 
intake 
•
While the overarching incident process is 
consistent, each support team has the 
bandwidth to personalize procedures
•
MIM is  at a higher maturity
•
Practice is well-deﬁned with three 
change types: Standard (pre-
approved), Normal, and Emergency.
•
Changes are perceived to be the major 
cause of incidents
•
Module is signiﬁcantly customized to 
support process
•
Major problem management is mature, 
featuring structured workflows, evidence-
based RCA, and clear accountability
•
The enterprise problem management 
process is inconsistent and team-driven, 
with low overall adoption of the problem 
module
•
Boeing’s release management is 
thorough.
•
Release deployments are managed as 
formal events, often done after-hours 
or in maintenance windows.
•
The team is actively working on DPR, to 
enhance integration with ADO

Core concepts for usage
Instruction 
Any communication where a 
human or system is providing 
guidance, input, or direction to a 
machine via the GAI Controller
Examples:
• Click “Summarize” button
• //get incidents created yesterday
• “It’s too long, make it shorter”
Action 
A set of instructions to 
accomplish a specific task
Examples:
• Click “Summarize” button
• //get incidents created yesterday
•
“Summarize this case”
•
> “Also add the resolution information”
•
> “It’s too long, make it shorter”
Assist
Currency for capturing 
the cost and value of the 
assist actions (mapping 
between an action and its 
price tag per assist tier)
Each Action will use one or more Assists
More complex Actions will use more Assists

Assessment
Answers
Are there additional input fields that would facilitate 
summarization? 
Are Short Description and Description fields out-of-
box?
Are State choice values out-of-box?
Is the Resolution workflow out-of-box or are there any 
customizations around task resolution to be aware 
of?
Are the agent roles out-of-box or are any custom 
roles used that need to be factored in? 
Is the plan to move all agent to Next Experience UI? 
I.e. newest workspace? If so, when?
